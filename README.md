# SOAP_API

> This project demonstrates how to integrate with SOAP-based web services. It includes practical examples of making requests, handling authentication, and processing responses. The goal is to provide a solid foundation for working with SOAP APIs in various scenarios.

## üöÄ What is SOAP?

**SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)** is a protocol used for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services. It relies on XML messages to define its request and response formats, ensuring that systems, often from different platforms, can communicate over the internet.

### Key Features of SOAP:
- **Protocol-Based**: SOAP defines a strict messaging structure based on XML.
- **Platform-Independent**: SOAP can work on top of protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, and more, making it suitable for a variety of use cases.
- **Standardized**: SOAP is highly standardized, with well-defined rules for request and response formatting.
- **Built-in Security**: It supports WS-Security standards for message encryption and authentication.

In this project, you'll learn how to send SOAP requests and handle SOAP responses, which can be essential for integrating with many legacy systems and web services.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/petersonchiquetto/SOAP_API.git
   cd SOAP_API
   ```

2. **Install necessary Python packages**:

   This project requires `requests` and `xml` modules. Install them using pip if they are not already installed:

   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

3. **Setup your SOAP API endpoint and authentication**:

   Edit the `api_integration.py` file to include your SOAP API endpoint and any required authentication details.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Usage

### Making a SOAP Request

The `api_integration.py` script contains the main logic for interacting with the SOAP API. Below is an example of how to send a SOAP request:

```python
import requests

# URL of the SOAP API endpoint
url = "https://example.com/soap-endpoint"

# Define the SOAP request body
headers = {'Content-Type': 'text/xml; charset=utf-8'}
body = '''<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:web="http://www.example.com/webservice">
   <soapenv:Header/>
   <soapenv:Body>
      <web:GetInfo>
         <web:requestParam>12345</web:requestParam>
      </web:GetInfo>
   </soapenv:Body>
</soapenv:Envelope>'''

# Make the SOAP request
response = requests.post(url, data=body, headers=headers)

# Output the response
print(response.text)
```

This script sends a SOAP request and prints the response from the API.

## üé® Example of SOAP Response

A sample response from the API might look like this:

```xml
<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:web="http://www.example.com/webservice">
   <soapenv:Header/>
   <soapenv:Body>
      <web:GetInfoResponse>
         <web:responseParam>Success</web:responseParam>
      </web:GetInfoResponse>
   </soapenv:Body>
</soapenv:Envelope>
```

You can modify the `api_integration.py` script to process the SOAP response as needed.
